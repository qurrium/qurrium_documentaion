## Why name Qurry🍛/Qurrium📏

1. The name **qurrent** was the second proposed name for this package.
   It’s not simply **current** with a **q** replacing the **c**,
   but rather a combination of **qurr** and **ent**, where **ent** abbreviates **entropy**,
   and **qurr** is a coined prefix beginning with **qu** to imply **quantum**.

2. The initial proposed name for the package was **xproc**, short for **experimental process**.

3. Another module, **qurrech**, combines **qurr** with **ech**,
   where **ech** is short for **echo**,
   the Loschmidt echo being a key concept in quantum information theory.
   This inspired us to adopt **qurry**, derived from **qurr** and the suffix **ry**,
   to resemble words like **query** or **curry**.

4. Since a package named **qurry** already exists on PyPI,
   and many projects on GitHub also use this name,
   we changed the suffix from **y** to **ium**, creating **qurrium**.
   **Qurrium** is unique and easily searchable,
   with no prior use on PyPI or in general web searches.

5. So there is the evolution of the package name:
   **`xproc -> qurrent -> qurry -> qurrium`**
