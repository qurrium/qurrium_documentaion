# Qurrium üìè - The python package for measuring quantum entanglement entropy and wave function overlap.

## _The python package that makes the randomized measurement easy._

The major function includes the measurement of quantum Renyi Entropy and Wave Function Overlap based on the randomized measurement protocol.
When interfaced with **IBM Qiskit**, the package automates the workflow from creating experiment objects, job submission and recall and postprocessing.  
There are several additional features, such as measurement of magnetization and error mitigation. Please check them out!

  abstract   = {In this thesis, we explore the quench dynamics of the Su‚ÄìSchrieffer‚ÄìHeeger (SSH) model and quantum entanglement using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, specifically on the IBM Quantum platform. We investigate the second-order Renyi entropy through randomized measurements to characterize the entanglement of quantum states. To simulate partial-dimerized quench Hamiltonians, we employ Trotter decomposition with an adaptive step size to reduce circuit depth. In the fully dimerized limit, the time evolution operator is exactly mapped to quantum gates, which minimizes noise. After applying error mitigation techniques, we find that the entanglement entropy oscillations align with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we developed a Python package called Qurry to manage workflows and facilitate parallel post-processing. Finally, we analyze the error scaling of Renyi entropy measurements and discuss the challenges encountered when simulating larger systems.},

## Installation

### By PyPI - Stable Release

- The package can be found in `pip list` as `qurrium-x.y.z`
- Pip downloads the most stable release, but not necessarily the latest version.

```bash
pip install qurrium
```

### By TestPyPI - Nightly Release

- This package can be found in `pip list` as `qurry-x.y.z.devW`
- This version includes new features and minor bug fixes, but may not be stable.

```bash
pip install qiskit tqdm requests
# the installation from testPyPI can' t find these dependencies
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qurry
```

### Maually by Git

**Qurry can be installed from source**. Since this package relies on Cython and Rust, **it requires "C complier" and "Rust complier" which you need to install first.**

To install rust, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then install `qurrium` by the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qurrium/qurrium.git --recursive
cd qurrium
pip install -e .
```

#### Test Installation

`pytest` is used for testing. Simply run the following command after the installation:

```bash
pytest
```

## Environment

**Qurry currently <ins>SUPPORT qiskit 0.46.0+ and qiskit 1.0.0+</ins>, other lower versions are no longer available.
The package has been tested on the following systems.**

- **Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS (All ManyLinux 2014 compatible distro)**
  - on `x86_64` **(recommended)**
  - on `x86_64` Windows 10/11 WSL2 **(recommended)**
  - on `aarch64`
  - We strongly recommend to use Linux based systems because Python multiprocessing may exist issues on Windows and the NVIDIA CUDA acceleration of `Qiskit`, `qiskit-aer-gpu` are supported only on Linux.
- **Windows 10/11**
  - on `x86_64`
- **MacOS 11+**

  - on `aarch64 (Apple Silicon, M1/M2/M3/M4 chips)`
  - on `x86_64 (Intel chips)`
  - **The depedent modules are as follows.**

- with required modules:
  - [`qiskit`](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/), [`tqdm`](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/), [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- with optional modules:
  - `qiskit-aer`: The complete simulator package of `qiskit`
  - `qiskit-aer-gpu`: The gpu acceleration of `qiskit-aer` on Linux with Nvidia GPU
    - `qiskit-aer-gpu-cu11`: A package for CUDA 11
  - `qiskit-ibm-runtime`: The API to access IBM Quantum Device
  - `qiskit-ibm-provider`: The API to access IBM Quantum Device, but will be deprecated soon.
  - `qiskit-ibmq-provider`: The API to access IBM Quantum Device, which has been deprecated.
