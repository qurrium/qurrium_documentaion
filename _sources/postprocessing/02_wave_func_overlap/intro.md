# Wave Function Overlap

2. [Randomized Measurement](./2_randomized_measure.ipynb)
3. [Randomized Measurement V1 - the deprecated version](./3_randomized_measure_v1.ipynb)
   - This method is deprecated, and we recommend **not** using it for post-processing except when dealing with data from versions **below `0.9.1`**
   - `EntropyRandomizedMeasureV1` is a deprecated version of `EntropyRandomizedMeasure` because it lacks clarity on the relationship between bitstrings and qubit indices. This limitation can easily cause confusion, especially when working with systems that do not measure all qubits. However, it is retained for backward compatibility.
