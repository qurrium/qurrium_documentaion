# Platform Support

The followings are the OS and hardware architecture we support.

It's basically following [the platform support of Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install#operating-system-support).

## Available Python Version

![Available Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9_|_3.10_|_3.11_|_3.12_|_3.13-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/qurrium)](https://pepy.tech/project/qurrium)

Qurrium üìè is written in Python 3.9 type annotation.
It can't and won't support Python 3.8 and below since they are too old.

## Available Operation System and Processor Architecture

We strongly recommend to use Linux based system, due to Python multiprocessing may exist some unknown issue on Windows and the GPU acceleration of `Qiskit`, `qiskit-aer-gpu` only works with Nvidia CUDA on Linux.

1. All CPython builds are based on the 3.9+ CPython ABI.
2. `windows_arm64` builds will provide **irregularly**. Also they have not been properly tested, as we do not have access to such a machine for testing. Also this build **is not in platform support** of `qiskit` and `qiskit-aer`.
3. All Linux builds are based on `manylinux2014`, consistent with Qiskit's approach for their Linux builds.
4. `macos_x86_64` builds no longer provided since `0.13.0`, as Apple has transitioned to ARM64 architecture a.k.a. Apple Silicon. Consider using `universal2` builds instead, which support both `x86_64` and `arm64` architectures. Usually, your `pip install` will automatically select the appropriate architecture based on your system.

- **All ManyLinux 2014 compatible distro**

  Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS, Rocky Linux, ...

  - Linux `x86_64` Distribution will be **first distribution** to get the latest Qurrium üìè release.

  - on `x86_64` **(recommended)**
    - Synology NAS with a finely-tuned Python environment.
      - ["Your NAS can also perform Quantum Computing!"](https://www.threads.net/@harui_2019/post/DCe_flgTVSR?xmt=AQGz8x3XKpPWT3XmW9qBngiKuobCM14Hh7JaqpMJAa2qOg) ü§Ø
  - on `x86_64` Windows 10/11 WSL2 **(recommended)**
  - on `aarch64`
    - Fujitsu Quantum Simulator with `qiskit-qulacs` making `qulacs` as a `qiskit` backend to run.
    - Android Terminal emulator `Termux` with `proot-distro`, so you can run this on your Android device if you know how to do.
      - If you want to try this, I suggest using the devices with sufficient performance CPU like Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 with 10GiB RAM at least.

      - iSH on iOS/iPadOS can not even handle python environment building although iPad has powerful performance üò¶

- **Windows 10/11**

  - on `x86_64`
    - For Windows users, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS for better compatibility and performance.
  - on `x86_32`
  - on `ARM64` **(not guaranteed)**
    - **Disclaimer**: Although we provide the distribution for Windows ARM, we cannot guarantee its functionality.
    - Since this distribution was built using cross-compilation, and we don't have a Windows ARM device for it's rare, full testing could not be performed.

- **MacOS 11+**

  - on `arm64 (Apple Silicon)`
  - on `x86_64 (Intel chips)`
    - We provide `arm64` and `universal2` wheels for installation.

## Dependencies

- with required modules: `qiskit`, `tqdm`, `requests`

- with optional modules:
  - `qiskit-aer`: The Qiskit simulator with more performance.
  - `qiskit-aer-gpu`: The CUDA acceleration only on Linux.
    - `qiskit-aer-gpu-cu11`: Extra support for CUDA11.
  - `jax`: The JAX acceleration for the post-processing of `ClassicalShadow`.
