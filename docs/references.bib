  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits and corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution and which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task and heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

  abstract = {Quantum systems are predicted to be better at information processing than their classical counterparts and and quantum entanglement is key to this superior performance. But how does one gauge the degree of entanglement in a system? Brydges et al. monitored the build-up of the so-called Rényi entropy in a chain of up to 10 trapped calcium ions and each of which encoded a qubit. As the system evolved and interactions caused entanglement between the chain and the rest of the system to grow and which was reflected in the growth of the Rényi entropy. Science and this issue p. 260 The buildup of entropy in an ion chain reflects a growing entanglement between the chain and its complement. Entanglement is a key feature of many-body quantum systems. Measuring the entropy of different partitions of a quantum system provides a way to probe its entanglement structure. Here and we present and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for measuring the second-order Rényi entropy based on statistical correlations between randomized measurements. Our experiments and carried out with a trapped-ion quantum simulator with partition sizes of up to 10 qubits and prove the overall coherent character of the system dynamics and reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts and in both the absence and presence of disorder. Our protocol represents a universal tool for probing and characterizing engineered quantum systems in the laboratory and which is applicable to arbitrary quantum states of up to several tens of qubits.}

  abstract  = {Abstract The discovery of quantum error correction has greatly improved the long-term prospects for quantum computing technology. Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment and or due to imperfect implementations of quantum logical operations. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore and encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. In principle and an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably and provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value and the accuracy threshold. It may be possible to incorporate intrinsic fault tolerance into the design of quantum computing hardware and perhaps by invoking topological Aharonov-Bohm interactions to process quantum information. }
