# Qurrium 📏 - The python package for measuring quantum entanglement entropy and wave function overlap.

## _The python package that makes the randomized measurement easy._

The major function includes the measurement of quantum Renyi Entropy and Wave Function Overlap based on the randomized measurement protocol.
When interfaced with **IBM Qiskit**, the package automates the workflow from creating experiment objects, job submission and recall and postprocessing.  
There are several additional features, such as measurement of magnetization and error mitigation. Please check them out!

  abstract   = {In this thesis, we explore the quench dynamics of the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model and quantum entanglement using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, specifically on the IBM Quantum platform. We investigate the second-order Renyi entropy through randomized measurements to characterize the entanglement of quantum states. To simulate partial-dimerized quench Hamiltonians, we employ Trotter decomposition with an adaptive step size to reduce circuit depth. In the fully dimerized limit, the time evolution operator is exactly mapped to quantum gates, which minimizes noise. After applying error mitigation techniques, we find that the entanglement entropy oscillations align with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we developed a Python package called Qurry to manage workflows and facilitate parallel post-processing. Finally, we analyze the error scaling of Renyi entropy measurements and discuss the challenges encountered when simulating larger systems.},
