## Why name Qurry / Qurrium

1. The name **qurrent** was the second proposed name for this package.
   It‚Äôs not simply **current** with a **q** replacing the **c**,
   but rather a combination of **qurr** and **ent**, where **ent** abbreviates **entropy**,
   and **qurr** is a coined prefix beginning with **qu** to imply **quantum**.

2. The initial proposed name for the package was **xproc**, short for **experimental process**.

3. Another module, **qurrech**, combines **qurr** with **ech**,
   where **ech** is short for **echo**,
   the Loschmidt echo being a key concept in quantum information theory.
   This inspired us to adopt **qurry**, derived from **qurr** and the suffix **ry**,
   to resemble words like **query** or **curry**.

4. Since a package named **qurry** already exists on PyPI,
   and many projects on GitHub also use this name,
   we changed the suffix from **y** to **ium**, creating **qurrium**.
   **Qurrium** is unique and easily searchable,
   with no prior use on PyPI or in general web searches.

5. So there is the evolution of the package name:
   **`xproc -> qurrent -> qurry -> qurrium`**

  abstract   = {In this thesis, we explore the quench dynamics of the Su‚ÄìSchrieffer‚ÄìHeeger (SSH) model and quantum entanglement using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, specifically on the IBM Quantum platform. We investigate the second-order Renyi entropy through randomized measurements to characterize the entanglement of quantum states. To simulate partial-dimerized quench Hamiltonians, we employ Trotter decomposition with an adaptive step size to reduce circuit depth. In the fully dimerized limit, the time evolution operator is exactly mapped to quantum gates, which minimizes noise. After applying error mitigation techniques, we find that the entanglement entropy oscillations align with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we developed a Python package called Qurry to manage workflows and facilitate parallel post-processing. Finally, we analyze the error scaling of Renyi entropy measurements and discuss the challenges encountered when simulating larger systems.},
